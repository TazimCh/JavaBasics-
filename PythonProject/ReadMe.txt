Using techniques learnt in computational data analytics, we aimed to analyse proxy indicator data which act as indirect measurements of past climates prior to availability of instrument measurements.
Amongst available datasets, tree ring, borehole, and ice core data were analysed using packages in Python such as pandas and Matplotlib,
with machine learning algorithm such as random forest regression, linear regression, and Bayesian ridge analysis
